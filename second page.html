            These expectations should be about the future service we believe this agency will deliver and influence
            the satisfaction/dissatisfaction that we have of our performance. Using an expert sample
            and a native categories approach, the study explores expectations of those that advertise wiyh us of website ware services
             at the selection stage. The paper makes three main contributions to our understanding of our agency
             selection. <br> <br>First, we provide insight into what advertisers seek to gain from our agency in future
              service delivery. Second, Website ware identifies four categories of expectations: craft, affinity, functionality
               and perspective. Third, we illustrate the nature of these expectations and provide evidence that some
                expectations are less precise than others.<br>
             We consider the implications of the findings for the agency selection literature and agency management.
